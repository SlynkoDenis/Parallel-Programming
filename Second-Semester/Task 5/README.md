# Euler Number calculation with OpenMP

Program calculates the euler number using Taylor series with the given number of terms.

Build the `arctg.c` to compute function `arctg(x)` with the arbitrary number of terms in
any point `x: |x| <= 1` - **\* task condition is satisfied**.

Use either CMakeLists.txt or combination of build.sh (**requires source file as argument**)
& run.sh scripts (requires using `-not` option denoting number of threads)
